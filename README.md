# VEX-PID #

Before use note:
Calibrate the Vision Sensor for RED objects, or any color as long as the color sig is named REDD
Motors are four 600rpm motors geared 36/60, two on each side.
Wheels are 4in Omniwheels.
PID constants have not been tuned that much, so tinker with them a bit.
Explanation for the code is to the right of it.
Have fun and good luck in future VRC games!
